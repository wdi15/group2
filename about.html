<h4 id="h4First">What Is Happening To Our Bees?</h4> 
  <p class="paraQuote">“If the bee disappeared off the surface of the globe, then man would have only four years of life left. No more bees, no more pollination, no more plants, no more animals, no more man.”<p class="paraAuthor">- Albert Einstein</p></p>
  <p class="paraContent">Throughout the past few years, beekeepers around the world have noticed that the bees have been mysteriously disappearing. The deaths have been connected to climate change, insecticide/pesticide, and intensive farming. Nectar from a flower is the food of the bees, and in return, the bees help the flowers reproduce; the bee gets covered in pollen from the stamen (male part of flower), which then gets deposited onto the stigma (female part of flower). The pollen goes to ovary, forming a seed, eventually blossoming into flower, and the cycle starts again. As poet Kahlil Gibran beautifully puts it: <b>“To the bee, a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower, the bee is a messenger of love.”</b></p>
  <h4 class="h4Content">Why and How?</h4> <!-- Could also separate this question into two parts- 1. why 2. how (diff headers)-->
  <p class="paraContent">Scientific research has shown that a major reason why bees are disappearing is due to <b>Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)</b>, which kills 40% of colonies every year. This is a phenomenon where the majority of worker bees disappear from the hive, never to return. An estimated one third of all honey bees in the United States of America have vanished due to Colony Collapse disorder. This disorder is most likely triggered by pesticides like neonicotinoids, disease-bearing parasites or pathogens, poor nutrition and industrial agriculture.</p>
  <h4 class="h4Content">How Does It Affect Us?</h4>
  <p id="paraLast">Human history has shown that bees are an integral part of our lives. 20,000 year old cave drawings depict images of honey hunting, where ancient Egyptians transported their hives along the Nile to pollinate crops. They also buried their pharaohs with containers full of honey to sweeten the afterlife and to create artificial light. Moreover, the antibacterial and antiseptic properties of honey has made it as important to the apothecary as to the chef over the centuries, and in the 15th century, the pilgrim fathers took their bees with them to spread their farming practices and colonies to the new world. Presently, bees pollinate a third of the world’s crops which are worth $190 billion. Bees pollinate food for human consumption, like fruits, vegetables, cocao beans, coffee and tea,  to food for livestock, and even cotton. Furthermore, as guardians of the food chain and biodiversity, bees pollinate food for wild animals.
