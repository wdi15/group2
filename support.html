<div class="content">
<h4 id="h4First"><b>Plant bee-friendly flowers and herbs in your garden and yard.</b></h4>
<p class="paraContent">With the increased use of chemicals, pesticides, monoculture-based farming practices, pristine green lawns, and destruction of natural landscapes, bees are losing habitat at a rapid rate globally. As bees like volume of forage, plant flowers and herbs with the same type of bloom together in your garden or yard. Some good plant varieties include: Spring – lilacs, penstemon, lavender, sage, verbena, and wisteria. Summer – Mint, cosmos, squash, tomatoes, pumpkins, sunflowers, oregano, rosemary, poppies, black-eyed Susan, passion flower vine, honeysuckle. Fall – Fuschia, mint, bush sunflower, sage, verbena, toadflax.</p>
<h4 class="h4Content">Don't use chemicals and pesticides on your garden or yard.</h4>
<p class="paraContent">Identifying as one of the major culprits of Colony Collapse Disorder, <b>chemicals and pesticides damage the hives</b>. Sure, these things may make your garden or lawn look pristine and pretty, but when it comes down to it, chemicals and pesticides do the opposite to the biosphere. It is particularly damaging when these are sprayed during blooming season, as it can transfer to the pollen and nectar, that is then taken to the bee hive, and into the honey, which ultimately, can get to us, as humans.
<h4 class="h4Content">Buy raw and local honey.</h4>
<p class="paraContent">The honey you buy <b>sends a message to the beekeepers</b> about how they should treat their bees. In 2011, it was discovered that large portions of the stock on North American grocery store shelves was likely illegally obtained from China, and the fact that the honey is ultra-filtered, meaning that there is no trace of pollen in the honey. Additionally, the honey you purchase may be labeled as a product of Australia or Thailand, but there's a good chance that it is a blend of honey that came from multiple sources.In many cases, imported honey has been diluted with corn syrup or sugar water, and contaminated with antibiotics or pesticides. So, for the sake of your health, buy honey that is: raw for its beneficial digestive enzymes and local to keep your farmer and bees in business.</p>
<h4 class="h4Content">Put a small basin of fresh water outside your home.</h4>
<p class="paraContent"><b>Bees are thirsty.</b> An overlooked fact that is true. If you have started a garden or yard of bee-friendly flowers and herbs, placing a basin of fresh water outside your home will aid the bees in achieving their goal of getting back to the hive with pollen before dying from dehydration.</p>
<h4 class="h4Content">Bees aren't out to get you; they're vegetarian.</h4>
<p class="paraContent">All bees want to do are forage for pollen and nectar which is used for food when they bring it back to their hives. Contrary to what the media tells us, <b>bees are not out to sting us.</b> Here's a few tips to avoid getting stung: 
<ol class="paraContent">
  <li class="firstItem">Stay still and calm if a bee is around or lands on you. They can smell the pheromones that come with fear and anger, which can trigger them to sting you.</li>
  <li>Don’t stand in front of a hive opening, or a pathway to a concentration of flowers. Bees are busy running back and forth from the hive, and if you don’t get in their way, they won’t be in yours.</li>
  <li class="lastItem">Learn to differentiate between bees and wasps. Honeybees die after they sting humans, wasps do not. Wasps are carnivores, so they like your sandwiches and fruits.</li>
